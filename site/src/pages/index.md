I am a Boston based web developer, currently employed at
[Salsify](https://www.salsify.com).

I'm originally from Abington, Massachusetts, but have been living all around
Boston for the last 8 years, currently residing in the North End neighborhood.

If I'm not working on various side projects, and it is between the months of
October and June (playoffs permitting), you will most likely find me heading
to the TD Garden for a Celtics game.
